Provide a platform where teachers may schedule and upload resources such as videos, presentations, flowcharts, and notes. For greater openness, teachers should be able to prepare, arrange, and display the curriculum for the following weeks.  

Find and use apps that let various users—teachers, parents, and kids, for example—make comments, tag relevant persons and subjects, and post questions.
